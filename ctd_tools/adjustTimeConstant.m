function timeConstant = adjustTimeConstant(profile1, profile2)
%ADJUSTTIMECONSTANT - Profile sensor time lag constant adjustment.
% This function receives as input parameters two profiles assumed to be
% downcast' and 'upcast', supposed to be measuring the same water column
% in different directions.
% Based on the assumption that both profiles should be as similar as
% possible, it finds the sensor timelag parameter, such that the area
% in a Value-Depth diagram between the corrected profiles is minimum.
%
% Syntax: timeConstant = adjustTimeConstant(profile1, profile2)
%
% Inputs:
%    profile1 - Profile structure*
%    profile2 - Profile structure*
%
% * Profile structure: A struct that contains several fields,
%   all of them column vectors with the same length:
%   - time: Present time instant at which this row was collected
%   - data: Value of any variable measured by the CTD
%
% Outputs:
%    timeConstant - Value containing the sensor time lag found
%
% Example:
%    timeConstant = adjustTimeConstant(profile1, profile2)
%
% Other m-files required: none
% Subfunctions: none
% MAT-files required: none
