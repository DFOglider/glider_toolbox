glider_toolbox
==============

The [glider toolbox][1] is a set of MATLAB/Octave scripts developed at 
[SOCIB][2] to manage the data collected by a glider fleet. It covers the main 
stages of the data management process both in real time and delayed time mode,
including metadata aggregation, data downloading, data processing, and output 
product and figure generation.
